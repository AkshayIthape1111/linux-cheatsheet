* **Command prompt** - the brief text automatically provided by the shell at the left hand side of each line in a console or terminal window.

* **Shell** - is a program that provides the traditional, text-only user interface for Unix-like operating systems. Its primary function is to read commands that are typed into a console or terminal window and then execute them, i.e. tell the operating system what to do. Examples of shells: zsh, bash, sh.

* **Environmental variables** are a class of variables that tell the shell how to behave as a user works at the command line or in shell scripts. They can be, and often are, set differently for each user.

* **Process** is a running instance of a program. Processes are managed by the kernel and each process has an ID associated with it called the process ID (PID). This PID is assigned in the order that processes are created.

* **System log files** - automatically updated files that contain records of events that have occurred on a system.

* **Data packet** is an all-encompassing term that represents any single set of binary data being sent across a network link. This term is not tied to any specific layer of [a networking model](networking-modes.md) or technology. It just represents a concept of one set of data to be sent form point A to point B. So when speaking about the layer of networking models, it's safe to say, for example, that data packets at the data link layer are called frames.

* **Hash** is a short unique identifier for a much bigger set of data. Often used as mechanism to verify the integrity of the data as the result of the trasmission on the network.

* A **nameserver** is a computer that answers questions about domain names, such as "what is the IP addresses of this domain name?".
