* **Command prompt** - the brief text automatically provided by the shell at the left hand side of each line in a console or terminal window.

* **Shell** - is a program that provides the traditional, text-only user interface for Unix-like operating systems. Its primary function is to read commands that are typed into a console or terminal window and then execute them, i.e. tell the operating system what to do. Examples of shells: zsh, bash, sh.

* **Environmental variables** are a class of variables that tell the shell how to behave as a user works at the command line or in shell scripts. They can be, and often are, set differently for each user.

* **Process** is a running instance of a program. Processes are managed by the kernel and each process has an ID associated with it called the process ID (PID). This PID is assigned in the order that processes are created.

* **System log files** - automatically updated files that contain records of events that have occurred on a system.
