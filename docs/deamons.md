## Deamons

Daemons are a class of processes that run continuously in the background, rather than under the direct control of a user. The term is derived from the ancient Greek word daimon, which refers to a supernatural being that is intermediate between a human and a god, or similar to a guiding spirit. Daemons are generally easy to recognize because their names end with the letter d.

Daemons are usually launched automatically while a computer is booting up and then wait in the background until their services are required. They typically respond to hardware activity, to network requests or to other programs by performing specified tasks. They can also configure hardware (such as the daemon devfsd, which can provide intelligent management of device entries in the device filesystem on some Linux systems), run scheduled tasks (e.g., crond) and perform a variety of other functions.

Another example is the secure networking daemon, xinetd (eXtended InterNET services Daemon), which is usually launched during booting and listens passively until a program, such as FTP or telnet, requests a connection.
